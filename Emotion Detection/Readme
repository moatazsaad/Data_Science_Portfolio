Facial Keypoints & Emotion Detection
    This project involves the development of two distinct models for facial keypoints detection and emotion detection using deep learning techniques.

Facial Keypoints Project

    Data Exploration: Begins with an exploration of the dataset, including analysis of various facial features such as eye center coordinates and image pixels.

    Image Augmentation: Utilizes image augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the training data, including horizontal and vertical flips, brightness adjustment, and resizing.

    Model Development: Constructs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for facial keypoints detection, consisting of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling and fully connected layers.

    Evaluation and Testing: Evaluates the trained model using validation data to assess its performance in terms of accuracy and loss. Testing data is used to evaluate the model's generalization capabilities.

    Prediction: Applies the trained model to new images for prediction, detecting facial keypoints and providing valuable insights into facial expressions and behaviors.

Emotion Detection Project

    Data Exploration: Begins with an examination of the dataset, focusing on facial expressions labeled with different emotions.

    Image Augmentation: Utilizes image augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the training data, including horizontal and vertical flips, brightness adjustment, and resizing.

    Model Development: Constructs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for emotion detection, consisting of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling and fully connected layers.

    Evaluation and Testing: Evaluates the trained model using validation data to assess its performance in terms of accuracy and loss. Testing data is used to evaluate the model's generalization capabilities.

    Prediction: Applies the trained model to new images for prediction, classifying facial expressions into distinct emotion categories.

Data Source
    The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and datasets. It contains labeled facial images and corresponding annotations, making it suitable for training and evaluating facial analysis models.
