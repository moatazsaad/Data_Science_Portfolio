Summary for the Targeted Aid Marketing Campaign Project

1- Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
    Loaded the sales data and performed initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
    Handled missing values and converted data types as needed.
    Explored the distribution of various categorical features using bar plots.
    Created dummy variables for categorical columns and encoded categorical features where necessary.
    Visualized the distribution of sales over time and identified peaks in sales.

2- K-Means Clustering:
    Utilized K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
    Determined the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
    Analyzed cluster characteristics, such as average quantity ordered, average sales, and preferred product types, to understand distinct customer segments.
    Visualized cluster characteristics using histograms to identify patterns and differences among clusters.

3- Dimension Reduction with PCA:
    Reduced the dimensionality of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize customer clusters in three-dimensional space.
    Visualized customer clusters using a 3D scatter plot to gain insights into the distribution and separation of clusters.

4- Autoencoder for Dimensionality Reduction:
    Implemented an autoencoder neural network for dimensionality reduction.
    Trained the autoencoder model on the scaled data and evaluated its performance.
    Utilized the encoder part of the autoencoder to transform the data into a lower-dimensional space.
    Applied K-Means clustering on the reduced data to identify customer clusters.
    Analyzed and visualized cluster characteristics similar to the K-Means clustering approach.

5- Conclusion:
    Identified distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior using both traditional clustering techniques and neural network-based dimensionality reduction methods.
    Provided actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies, such as personalized promotions and product recommendations tailored to specific customer clusters.
