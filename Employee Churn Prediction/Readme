This data science project focuses on predicting employee churn using machine learning techniques. Here's a summary of the key steps and findings:

    Data Collection and Exploration:
        The dataset contains various features including demographics, job-related factors, and satisfaction levels of employees.
        Initial exploration revealed potential correlations between certain features and employee attrition.

    Data Preprocessing:
        Preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and scaling numerical features.
        The dataset was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

    Exploratory Data Analysis:
        Analysis revealed insights such as:
            Younger employees tended to leave more.
            Employees in certain job roles or marital statuses showed higher attrition rates.
            Distance from home and years with the current manager influenced attrition.

    Modeling and Evaluation:
        Various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and XGBoost were trained and evaluated.
        Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing model based on accuracy.

    Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
        An ANN model was also developed and trained, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.

    Conclusion:
        The project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting employee churn.
        Logistic Regression was identified as the most suitable model for this prediction task,Additionally the ANN demonstrated promising results providing insights that can help HR departments in devising retention strategies.
