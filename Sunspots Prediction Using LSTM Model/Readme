Project Overview:
Sunspots are areas on the Sun's surface with strong magnetic fields, and their activity follows an 11-year cycle. This project aims to predict sunspot activity using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.

Data Source:
The sunspots data is sourced from Kaggle, spanning from January 1749 to January 2021. The dataset includes monthly mean total sunspot numbers.

Model Architecture:
The LSTM model consists of convolutional and LSTM layers followed by densely connected layers. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent with Huber loss as the loss function.

Training and Optimization:
The training data is windowed to capture temporal patterns, and a learning rate scheduler is employed to find the optimal learning rate. The model is trained with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Evaluation:
The model is evaluated on the validation data using Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Additionally, the model's forecast is plotted against the actual sunspot data to visualize its performance.

Results:
The LSTM model demonstrates the ability to capture the cyclic nature of sunspot activity. The validation MAE indicates the model's accuracy in predicting sunspot numbers.

Conclusion:
The LSTM model shows promise in forecasting sunspot activity, which can contribute to better understanding solar dynamics and space weather prediction.
