This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon Echo product reviews using natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.
1- Data Loading and Exploration:
    The Amazon Echo reviews dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure and characteristics.
    Visualizations like histograms and word clouds are utilized to analyze the distribution of ratings, feedback, and review texts.

2-  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
    Irrelevant columns are dropped, and categorical variables are converted into dummy variables.
    Punctuation and stop words are removed from review texts, and CountVectorizer is used to transform text data into numerical feature vectors.

3- Model Building:
    Three classification models; Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and XGBoost models are trained on preprocessed data to predict sentiment based on review content.
    The models are evaluated using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and classification reports.

4- Model Evaluation:
    All models performed reasonably well in predicting sentiment with logistic regression achieving higher accuracy.
    Confusion matrices and classification reports offer detailed insights into precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

5- Overall Impact:
    The project showcases the application of machine learning for sentiment analysis, providing valuable insights into customer perceptions of Amazon Echo products.
