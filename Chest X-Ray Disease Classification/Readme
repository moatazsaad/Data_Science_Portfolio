Chest X-Ray Disease Classification Model

This project aims to classify chest X-ray images into four categories: Covid-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and Bacterial Pneumonia. The model is developed using deep learning techniques, specifically transfer learning with the ResNet50 architecture pretrained on the ImageNet dataset.

Key Components:

- Data Preparation: The dataset consists of chest X-ray images divided into training and validation sets, Images are resized and normalized using data generators.

- Model Architecture: Transfer learning is employed using the ResNet50 model as a base. The model's architecture is extended with additional layers for classification, including pooling, flattening, dropout, and fully connected layers. The pre-trained layers of ResNet50 are frozen, and only the top layers are trained.

- Training: The model is trained using the training data generator with early stopping and model checkpointing to prevent overfitting and save the best model weights.

- Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated using the validation set. Training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to assess model performance.

- Testing: The trained model is tested on a separate test dataset, and accuracy metrics are calculated. Predictions are visualized alongside true labels using sample images from the test set.

- Model Deployment: The model architecture is saved to a JSON file, along with the best model weights. These files can be used for deployment in production environments.

This project serves as an example of using deep learning techniques for medical image classification, with potential applications in healthcare and disease diagnosis.
