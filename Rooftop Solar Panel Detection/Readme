Description:
Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect rooftop solar panels from aerial images. The project involved data preprocessing, model building, and performance assessment using cross-validation techniques.

Key Features:

- Utilized a dataset consisting of aerial images and corresponding labels indicating the presence of solar panels.
- Developed a CNN model architecture incorporating convolutional and batch normalization layers for image classification.
- Employed Stratified K-Fold cross-validation for robust performance evaluation and visualization of model predictions.
- Analyzed model performance metrics including True Positive Rate, False Positive Rate, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) to assess detection accuracy.

Results:

- Achieved accurate detection of rooftop solar panels with an AUC of [insert AUC value] on the ROC curve.
- Identified examples of True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives to demonstrate model predictions.
- Deployed the CNN model to identify solar panels in aerial images, facilitating sustainable energy planning and infrastructure development.
