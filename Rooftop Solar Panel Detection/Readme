Project Overview:
In this project, I developed a deep learning model to automatically detect the presence of rooftop solar panels in images. 
The goal was to create a robust system capable of identifying whether a given image contains solar panels or not.

Data Preprocessing:
I started by loading the dataset, which consisted of images along with corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of solar panels. 
Using OpenCV, I read the images and normalized the pixel values to enhance model performance.

Model Architecture:
For the detection task, I designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using TensorFlow/Keras. 
The model comprised several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by batch normalization and dense layers. 
The architecture was chosen to effectively capture spatial features in the images.

Training and Cross-Validation:
To train the model, I employed a cross-validation strategy to ensure robustness and generalization. 
Stratified K-Fold cross-validation was used to split the dataset into training and validation sets. 
During training, I incorporated class weights to handle class imbalance, as there were more images without solar panels than with.

Model Evaluation:
After training, I evaluated the model's performance using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. 
These metrics provided insights into the model's ability to correctly classify images with and without solar panels.

Prediction on Test Images:
Once the model was trained and evaluated, I applied it to predict the presence of solar panels in unseen test images. 
The predictions were made by feeding the test images through the trained model, and the results were analyzed to assess the model's real-world applicability.

Conclusion:
Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in detecting rooftop solar panels from images. 
By leveraging CNNs and appropriate evaluation methodologies, we can develop accurate and reliable models for various computer vision tasks, contributing to advancements in renewable energy monitoring and management.
