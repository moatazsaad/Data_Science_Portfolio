The data for this project was sourced from the Kaggle competition Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge.
Facial Keypoints Detection

1- The facial keypoints detection process involves the following steps:

- Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset is loaded, and exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the data distribution and structure.
- Data Augmentation: Image augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping, brightness adjustment, and vertical flipping are applied to increase the dataset's variability.
- Model Architecture: A ResNet model is constructed for facial keypoints detection, trained using mean squared error as the loss function.
- Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test set using root mean squared error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric.

2- Emotion Detection

The emotion detection process consists of the following steps:

- Data Loading and Exploration: The facial expression dataset is loaded and explored to understand the distribution of emotions.
- Data Preprocessing: The pixel values are processed and resized to prepare them for model training.
- Data Augmentation: Image augmentation techniques are applied to increase the dataset's diversity.
- Model Architecture: A CNN model is built for emotion detection, with convolutional and fully connected layers.
- Model Training: The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and evaluated on the test set.
- Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics and visualized through confusion matrices and classification reports.

3- Prediction

A function is created to make predictions using both the facial keypoints detection model and the emotion detection model. Test images are plotted with predicted keypoints and emotions.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for facial keypoints detection and emotion detection, showcasing the models' abilities to analyze and interpret facial expressions.
